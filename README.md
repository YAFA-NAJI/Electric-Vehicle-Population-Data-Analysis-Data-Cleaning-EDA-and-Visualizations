# Electric Vehicle Population Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The objective of this assignment is to analyze a real-world dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and effectively communicating insights.

## Dataset Overview
- **Source:** [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)
- **Provider:** State of Washington
- **Description:** This dataset contains information on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing.
- **Number of Features:** 17
- **Types of Features:** 
  - **Categorical:** VIN, Make, Model, County, City, Electric Type
  - **Numerical:** Electric Range, Model Year

## Steps and Requirements

### **1. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**
- **Missing Values Documentation:** Identify and report the frequency of missing values in each feature.
- **Handling Missing Values:** Apply different strategies such as mean/median imputation or row removal, and compare their impact.
- **Feature Encoding:** Convert categorical features (e.g., Make, Model) using one-hot encoding.
- **Normalization:** Normalize numerical features to improve analysis accuracy.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical features.
- **Spatial Distribution:** Visualize EV distribution across locations using maps.
- **Model Popularity:** Identify the most popular EV models and analyze trends.
- **Feature Correlation:** Examine relationships between numeric features using correlation analysis.

### **3. Visualization**
- **Data Exploration Visualizations:** Use histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots to analyze data distribution.
- **Comparative Visualization:** Use bar charts or stacked bar charts to compare EV distribution across different locations.

### **4. Additional Analysis (Optional)**
- **Temporal Analysis:** If time-series data is available, analyze trends in EV adoption rates and model popularity.
